    "text": "1 Introduction\nWhen choosing a topic for our final project, we brainstormed a few different ideas that were relevant to our current environment. There initial ideas included a climate analysis - we found data on regional climate variables (ex: precipitation, snow, max and min temperature, etc.), economic variables (ex: unemployment, inflation, etc.), prior Google Mobility data (indexed time spent in Parks, Grocery Stores, etc.), and NYPD crimes data (frequency of top 7 crimes, crimes at NY parks, etc.).\nTo narrow our search, we completed some high level analysis to examine the quality and depth of our data options. We looked at the different variables offered in each dataset, the duration and frequency of data collection, and how we may potentially be able to tie multiple datasets together.\nWe decided to analyze the crimes at NYC parks for a few different reasons. First, as NY residents, an analysis of a topic directly relevant to both of our lives was of high interest. Secondly, we saw that the depth of data available directly from the NYPD was robust, covering around 1 decade worth of data across different parks and different types of crimes. We immediately had several ideas for different types of analysis, data slicing, and visualizations we could show with this dataset. Lastly, in thinking about how it may correlate to other factors, we are planning to merge crime data with unemployment rates to determine if there are any correlations. We may also tentatively merge this data with Google Mobility data for time spent at parks in NY to determine if there is a correlation there, though we note that the data is only available for a few years and have been discontinued."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nAs we are studying crimes at NYC parks and potential reasons, we collected three datasets: crimes, unemployment, and mobility data.\nFirst, we collected crime data in NYC from NYPD official websites focused on crime statistics. The link for the data is NYPD Crime Statistics. The data covers quarters from 2014 to 2023. The data for each quarter shows features like numbers of crimes, park sizes, and boroughs. For our study, we focused on three factors: total number of different types of crimes, park size categories, and boroughs.\nSecond, we collected unemployment data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics official website focused on NYC area. The link of data is NYC Unemployment Statistics. Additionally, BLS Data Finder offered on this website is able to search unemployment data for NYC. Monthly unemployment data is available from 2013 to 2023.\nLast, we looked at high level mobility data from Google Community Mobility Reports. The link of data is Mobility Data. Daily data of movement trend in places such as parks is available in the Covid-19 period. A few restrictions on this data include: it is only available from February 2020 to October 2022, and the data must be scraped from the published reports. If we want to use the data, we will have to use a third party source that has scraped data into a csv file. The link for a potential scrape is from this GitHub Repo."

We conducted time series analysis to look into components including long term trends, seasonality (systematic, calendar related movements), and irregularity (unsystematic, short term fluctuations).\nHeatmaps and bar charts for crimes data. We illustrated crimes data in heatmaps based on boroughs and periods to find time and regional differences. Bar charts are used to show the specific numbers of crimes for boroughs.\nRelationship between crimes and employment rate. We looked into trends for total number of crimes and unemployment rates both annually and quarterly. We first demonstrated these two variables in scatterplots.\nRelationship between crimes and mobility data. For February 2020 to October 2022, we looked into the number of crimes and park attendance levels, investigating whether visitor flow affects crimes."
