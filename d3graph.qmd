# Interactive graph

Here, we show a pie chart with data from the most recent quarter, 3Q 2023. The graph shows the split of crimes that occurred during this quarter. This interactive graph allows users to select a borough and view the different types of crimes that occurred during 3Q 2024.

From the graph, we aim to encourage residents and tourists to be more aware of their surroundings. For example, when people visit parks in Manhattan, they should take extra care to protect personal belongings because grand larceny is the most frequent occurrence. In Bronx, it is advisable for people to exercise caution regarding robbery incidents. It may be prudent to consider traveling in groups for added safety and to remain vigilant of any suspicious persons nearby.
