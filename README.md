# NYC Parks Crime Analysis Project

## Overview
This project represents a comprehensive analysis of crime data in New York City parks. As New Yorkers ourselves, we embarked on this journey to delve into a topic that directly impacts our community. Our focus is on dissecting and understanding the various facets of crime within the city's parks, using extensive data provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD), U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Google.

## Objectives

In-depth Crime Analysis: To explore the nature and frequency of crimes in NYC parks, identifying patterns and trends over the years.

Correlation with Unemployment Rates: We aim to merge the crime data with unemployment rates to investigate potential correlations, thus offering insights into the socioeconomic aspects influencing crime rates.

Exploring Park Mobility Data: We plan to tentatively combine our findings with Google Mobility data, specifically focusing on the time spent in parks. This aspect of the analysis, however, is subject to data availability, as Google Mobility data covers only a few years and has been discontinued.

## Methodology
Our approach involves various methods of data slicing, manipulation, and visualization to present a clear and comprehensive picture of the crime landscape in NYC parks. We will employ statistical tools and data analysis to process and analyze the data. We include heatmaps, scatterplots, time series analysis, and other related techniques.

## Contributing

We summarize our findings here.

### Crimes Analysis:

- Crime rates fluctuate over time and tend to be higher in the third quarter.
- From 2015 to 2023, there's an overall increase in crime rates, with robbery and grand larceny being most frequent, except for a deviation in the Bronx.
- No clear correlation between the size of parks and the number of crimes.

### Unemployment Correlations:

- An inverse relationship is observed between unemployment rates and crime rates from 2013 to 2023, with lower crime during higher unemployment periods.
- This finding suggests a potential, but not definitive, linkage between economic conditions and crime rates.

### Mobility Data:
  
- During the pandemic, park visits varied significantly across boroughs, with Queens experiencing the largest increase.
- The number of parks in each borough did not directly correlate with park visitation trends.
- There were some similarities observed between trends in park visits and crime rates.
